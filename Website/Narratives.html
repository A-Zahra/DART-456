      <div class="projectDescription1" style="margin-top:5vw;">
        My Role: Produce a 10 second animation loop video that promotes invictus gloves’s custom gloves</br>
        Project Time: April – August 2020</br>
        Materials/Tools/Media: Blender Software, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro</br>
        Borrowed Materials: Gloves 3D Model</br>
        <a href="https://invictusgloves.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(213, 157, 33);">Invictus Gloves Website</a></br>
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=191933119349421" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(213, 157, 33);">Invictus Gloves Social Media page</a>
      </div>
      <div class="projectDescription" style="margin-bottom: 10vw;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GOALS:</span> Invictus Gloves is a Canadian company that produces its own brand, and custom sports gloves for athletes like football players. To
        showcase their custom products on their social media, they required a mesmerizing and memorable loop video. Large close-ups, warm tones, minimalist, and high contrast images are the four main features of this video that was asked by my client
        to be considered.
        </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">ChALLENGES:</span> The main challenge of this project was to make a video that well-represents Invictus gloves products. To overcome this challenge, I took two actions. On the one hand, I used Invictus
        gloves' original colors (Black, silver, gold) to texture-paint the scene components. On the other hand, to show the variety of colors and patterns the Invictus Gloves company can produce, three custom gloves with different colors and patterns
        are displayed during the animation loop.
        Moreover, the video should seize the customer's attention in 10 secs, and make them willing to watch it continuously. After watching several satisfying 3D animation videos online, I realized that the best way to keep customer attention is to
        make the video's content feel continuous and non-stop. Another advantage of creating satisfying movies is that; they show events that are almost impossible to happen in the real world. This feature might seem irrelevant to the content of the
        Invictus gloves promotional video at first sight. However, it constructs the structure of the Invictus gloves looping video. Making the gloves pass the central pillar’s hole and being dropped exactly on the specified plates every time,
        displays a high precision and accuracy that motivates the user to watch the video several times. This provides the company with two benefits. First, although the video's initial time is only 10 secs, its looping feature provides the
        corporation with enough time to leave its effect on the user's mind. Second, even if the customer does not need the product at that time, they will get back to it once it's required, as watching the video frequently makes the audience
        remember the logo and variety of the products that the company can produce.
        </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">OUTCOMES/PERSONAL GAIN:</span>Working on this project was a perfect opportunity for me, as it gave me the chance to create a 3D animation video for the first time and go through all the steps from
        ideation to implementation on my own. I learned how to make an object drag and drop other objects in the scene, how to make several objects rotate around a central piece and so on. Also, I learned new lighting styles and had the chance to
        review all my previous skills. The most crucial achievement of this project was that I got the chance to produce a product that my client was satisfied with and is currently using to promote its custom gloves.

        My Role: 3D modelling, texture painting, rigging and animating a 3D character</br>
        Project Time: September – November 2018</br>
        Tools/Material: Blender, Adobe Photoshop</br>
        Borrowed Materials: A 3D monster drawing</br>
      </div>
      <div class="projectDescription" style="margin-bottom: 10vw;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GOALS:</span> Aguman was a school final project done in the fall of 2018. This project's main goal was to enhance our 3D modeling, texture painting, rigging, lighting, and animating skills. 
      </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IDEATION PROCESS:</span> To have a starting point, our professor provided us with a monster character image. However, students were allowed to put forward their own ideas or manipulate the given character the way they liked. I decided to combine the given monster character with one of the spatial characters I always draw. Therefore, my toothless, one-eye, short tail monster turned into a monster with two eyes, two ivories, and a bifurcated tail.
    </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">CHALLENGES:</span> In the creation process, the first challenge I faced was at the texture painting level. To make the monster’s skin texture look smooth and uniform, I should carefully paint the spots I already didn't. Otherwise, the surface difference between the body's texture layers and the areas where the textures with two completely different angles had overlapped on the monster's body was quite obvious. The other challenge I confronted was at the rigging level. The monster's bones should stick to its body in a way that when he moved his wings or tail, his skin could be stretched and folded if he bent them.
      </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">OUTCOMES/PERSONAL GAIN:</span> This project was an exceptional experience for me. Under the supervision of a professional animator, I had the opportunity to create, texture paint, rig, and animate a 3D model from scratch and learn different lighting styles.

      <div class="projectDescription" style="margin-bottom: 10vw;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GOALS:</span> CRAFT is a new center for Research and Applications in Fluidic Technologies conducted by the Toronto University and NRC institution. In
        fall 2019, a logo competition was held by this organization to design a completely brand new logo for the institute.
        </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">ChALLENGES/IDEATION PROCESS:</span> To design a comprehensive logo that meets all different aspects of CRAFT organization, I decided to search about the concepts or tools relevant to their field of work
        and find symbols that are those concepts' representative. Through certain investigations, I realized that microfluidic channels are the most obvious platforms in fluidic technologies that most people active in this field are familiar with.
        Considering that the organization had stated that "Logo must include the acronym CRAFT", I decided to use this word's letters to illustrate microfluidic channels.
        Moreover, since the CRAFT organization - as the most important Centre for Microfluidic Systems in Chemistry & Biology in Canada - has international partners or customers, their nationality and origin should be visible through their logo. To
        do so, I decided to use colors that indicate Toronto University, NRC institute, and Canada in general. Also, I pictured a maple leaf using the negative space inside the letter "C", to emphasize that CRAFT is a Canadian organization.
        </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">OUTCOMES/PERSONAL GAIN:</span> Working on this project had several advantages for me. Participating in this competition allowed me to gain my first professional experience in the logo design field. I
        learned what elements are crucial to be considered in logo design and how a logo can truly represent an organization. I could illustrate a brand new logo for one of the most important organizations in the microfluidic field, and my design is
        now used everywhere on their website.

        logo that fully represents the community's mission and goals, the committee held a logo design contest in Summer 2019.
        </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IDEATION AND IMPELEMENTATION:</span> The Loyola-committee goal was my principal inspiration to design their logo. Considering that Loyola-Committee is one of the Concordia organizations, I decided to use
        the Concordia particular burgundy color to show this connection. To picture the socialization between students, I transformed the letter 'C' middle part to individuals that look like they gathered together. Moreover, to show the support and
        help that the Loyola committee provides its students with, I kept the letter “C” upper and lower parts as they were so that they look like two hands that have surrounded students.
        </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">CHALLENGES/PERSONAL GAIN:</span> The main challenge I encountered in this work was to design a logo that looks simple and easy to perceive and, at the same time, is expressive and representative of the
        Loyola-community. I learned how to recognize what characteristic of a team has the potential to turn into its symbol and is remarkable enough to be brought in their logo. Considering all the factors I mentioned above in the logo design
        process, let my design win the contest. The Loyola-committee team is now using this logo to represent their organization on their social media pages, their events' posters, etc.

      </div>
      <div class="projectDescription" style="margin-bottom: 15vw;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GOALS:</span> The jigsaw puzzle game was a programming course final project. In this project, we should demonstrate how well we have learned the
        materials presented throughout the semester. The programming languages we should use to create our game were Javascript, jQuery, and jQuery UI.
        To display my strength in working with these programming languages, I decided to create a two-level game that each game's level contained a different environment and purpose.
        One of the sources I got inspired by was my professor's online game called Chesses. In this game, he took a look at the game's rules and setup from a new perspective. To defeat the opponent, the player should move their tokens differently.
        </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">CHALLENGES/GAME DESCRIPTION:</span> Inspired by the Chesses game, I decided to program an online jigsaw puzzle game with rules, setup, and concept I defined for it. My game has two levels. In the first
        level, the puzzle pieces are in a carousel slideshow, and the puzzle board is hidden. To start the game, the player should drag a piece of the slideshow and place it in the right spot. To play the game properly, every time, the player should
        first click on the area they want to drop a piece otherwise their action is not counted, and they won't win or even lose. The principal challenge I experienced when I was programming the first level was programming the carousel slideshow. I
        wanted the slideshow to hide the empty spaces once the pieces got taken out of it. Also, I liked that the player could slide upward and downward by clicking on the arrows placed on top and bottom of the slideshow. Moreover, I wanted the user
        to be able to put the pieces back to their place if they had doubts about using them immediately. Applying all these features together to the slideshow was a new challenging programming experience. However, I could eventually resolve the
        problem through testing various methods and getting help from my teachers. In the second level, which is the harder one, the player demands to be fast and focused. This level has a timer made of 15 questions. Every 32 secs, the next question
        pops up. The player has 30 secs to answer the question. If their answer is wrong, the next question pops up instantly. But if it is right, they can keep placing the pieces on the puzzle board. The player can win the game if they complete the
        puzzle before the questions get finished. At this level, the most complex part was to create the timer. I should make sure that no repetitive question gets displayed in one round. Besides, the player should have enough time to find the
        answers. Furthermore, I tried to randomize the questions' list as much as possible so that no two players would see the same question order on the screen.
        </br><span style="font-weight: bold;">OUTCOMES/PERSONAL GAIN:</span> This project was a great achievement. I learned so much in the programming process, and I could gain valuable knowledge about JavaScript and jQuery languages. I learned how
        to simplify my code by reviewing and modifying it several times. I got familiar with a new library called Annyang, and I learned how to create my library using a JSON file.</div>
